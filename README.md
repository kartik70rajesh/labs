## About
Labs is a one stop for all Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiasts to learn and contribute to one of the several research activities carried out by SIESGSTarena team. Its a community driven project where every novice and experienced can make use of our datasets and try to come up with several visualizations, pre-trained models and any other research work which can be deployed on SIESGSTarena or published in general.

## Set of Experiments (just few examples, you can do more than what's said here)

* Recommendation of Blogs to users
* Recommendation of problems to users based on past submissions
* A statistical representation of progress of users in respective topics ('tags' feature in the dataset) of competitive programming in SIESGSTarena

**Refer [code-drills](https://www.code-drills.com/) for further clarity.**


## Communication

**GitHub Issues**: bug reports, feature requests, install issues, help wanted, thoughts, etc.

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions and make sure you go through our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you are planning to contribute back bug-fixes, please do so without any further discussion.  

If you plan to contribute new experiments, utility functions or extensions to the core, please first open an issue and discuss the feature/experiment with us.
Sending a PR without discussion might end up resulting in a rejected PR, because we might be taking Labs in a different direction than you might be aware of.
